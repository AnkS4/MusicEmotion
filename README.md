# MusicEmotion

MusicEmotion is a machine learning project that aims to predict the mood or emotion of a song based on its audio features.

By analyzing publicly available music datasets, this project aims to build a predictive model to classify or detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, excitement, or calm in songs.

## Process
#### Data Collection
Publicly available music datasets (e.g., the Million Song Dataset (MSD) or similar) are used to extract audio features. These features, such as tempo, energy, and valence, form the foundation for emotion prediction.

#### Model Training
A machine learning model is trained on the dataset. The features are mapped to predefined emotion categories (e.g., happy, sad, calm, or energetic), enabling accurate predictions.

#### Deployment
The trained model is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment and scalability across different environments.

#### Prediction
When provided with an input song or its audio features, the deployed model predicts the associated mood or emotion. Results are accessible via a simple API.
